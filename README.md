# Multi-UAV Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains my first machine learning project, which focuses on multi-UAV analysis. It includes two Jupyter notebooks: one for classification and another for regression tasks, with a special focus on handling imbalanced datasets.

## Content
1. **Classification Notebook**: Deals with a classification problem using a UAV dataset. The goal is to categorize data based on the number of potential collisions, facing the challenge of an imbalanced dataset.

2. **Regression Notebook**: Focuses on a regression task using the same UAV dataset. It predicts a continuous value, specifically the minimum distance at the closest point of approach between UAVs, again considering the imbalance in the data.

## Approach
Both notebooks follow a structured approach:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Analysis**: Conducting basic analysis to understand the dataset, with an emphasis on its imbalanced nature.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing different models for the classification and regression tasks, tailored to handle imbalanced data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of these models, with specific metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, Pandas and NumPy for data handling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

## Usage
To use these notebooks:
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook and the required Python libraries.
3. Open and run the notebooks to explore the analysis and results.

## Note
These notebooks provide an introduction to machine learning applications in UAV-related tasks, with a particular focus on the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets.
